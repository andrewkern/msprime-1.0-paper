\opening{Dear Editors,}

Please see enclosed the final version of our manuscript in PDF format.
I am unclear what the requirements for the Latex source and image
files are, and will therefore await instructions.

Unfortunately, I will need to revise the grant data provided in the
online form, as it is not complete. Can you advise on how to do this please?

\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
